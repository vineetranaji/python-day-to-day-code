# Python Day-to-Day Code

This project contains a collection of Python scripts that provide solutions to various common problems, including but not limited to mathematical calculations.

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to offer reusable code snippets that can be used in day-to-day programming tasks. The scripts are designed to be simple and easy to understand, making them suitable for both beginners and experienced programmers.

## Usage

To use the scripts, simply import the desired function from the corresponding task file. For example:

```python
from tasks.lcm import compute_lcm

# Example usage
lcm_result = compute_lcm(4, 5)
```

## Tasks

### LCM Calculation

The `lcm.py` file contains functions to calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) and the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers using recursion.

### LCM Using Math Module

The `lcm using math module.py` file contains a function to calculate the LCM of two numbers using Python's built-in `math` module.
